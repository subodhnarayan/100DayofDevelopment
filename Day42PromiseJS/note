code execution is sequence

callback

callback hell


//nesting

let age=19;

if(ajjj){
    if(cond){

    }
    else{

    }
}
else {

}  //nested if else 


nested loop

so there may be callback nesting 
this is callback hell


promise help to solve call back hell

promise has three state

pending
fullfill 
reject 


we only deal with fullfill and reject

promise.then  when prmoise resloved
promise.catch when promise rejected


callback callbackhell chaining


async is wait in any function

await is  use to keep waiting



//async-await
